# This is my bio! (^-^)/

## My story
👾🧫 My journey into biology began with video games like Pokémon, Spore, and BioShock, which sparked a deep curiosity about evolution, genetics, and even the mechanics behind plasmids. That curiosity eventually evolved into a career where I now merge my two greatest passions: biology and computer science. I like to approach data as a puzzle by discovering patterns to transform that complex datasets into clear, actionable results. Whether collaborating with a multidisciplinary R&D team, presenting insights to stakeholders or managing my own analysis process, I bring structure, creativity and problem solving to every project.
